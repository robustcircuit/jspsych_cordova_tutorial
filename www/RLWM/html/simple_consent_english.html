  <!-- Intro paragraph -->
  <p>
    You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time to read the following information carefully. Please contact the researcher if there is anything that is not clear or if you need more information.
  </p>

  <!-- Study purpose -->
  <h2>Purpose of the research:</h2>
  <p>
    We are looking to better understand the variability in human cognitive functions, such as learning, decision-making and working memory. We are also interested in how statistical features of the environment impact these functions.
  </p>

  <!-- Study duration -->
  <h2>Expected duration of participation:</h2>
  <p>
    <!-- Adapt for experiment -->
    The experiment should take about <font style="color:red">30 minutes</font> to complete, although its exact duration may partly depend on how fast and accurate your responses are.
  </p>

  <!-- Study procedures -->
  <h2>Study Procedures:</h2>
  <p>
    The experiment is divided in three phases. 
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>A learning task</li>
    <li>A few questionnaires</li>
    <li>Two short additional tasks</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Risks or discomforts -->
  <h2>Risks or discomforts as a result of participation:</h2>
  <p>
    The activities in the study carry no risk as they only involve operating a desktop computer. The task involved in the experiment does require some mental effort.
  </p>

  <!-- Only for studies using questionnaires -->
  <p>
    This study includes questions related to mental health: about your emotions and reactions to being placed in certain situations, and the levels at which you may identify with certain thoughts or feelings. Some participants may find these questions troubling. The experimenters are not clinicians and not in a position to diagnose any disorders or offer medical advice. If the questions trouble you, we urge you to seek further advice or information from healthcare professionals. 
  </p>

  <!-- Benefits -->
  <h2>Benefits as a result of participation:</h2>
  <p>
    There will be no direct benefit to you from this research, except insofar as you may learn something about psychology and may derive satisfaction from knowing that your participation has advanced scientific understanding of human cognition and mental health. Importantly, the study staff will not make any clinical diagnosis based on results from this study.
  </p>

  <!-- Confidentiality / National Data Archive -->
  <h2>Confidentiality:</h2>
  <p>
    Your responses, after removal of any identifiable private information, could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies, or shared as part of publication of the research study without additional informed consent from you. Data will be shared such that it cannot, in any way, be traced back to you.
    Importantly, this experiment <b>does not</b> record your IP address and <b>it does not request any personal identifier</b> (e.g. name, birthdate, etc). It is therefore anonymous.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every researcher (and institutions to which they belong) who requests use of your deidentified study data must promise to keep your data safe and promise not to try to learn your identity. 
  </p>
